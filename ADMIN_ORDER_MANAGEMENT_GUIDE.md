2. A dialog appears with agent dropdown
3. Select an agent from the list
   - Shows agent name and current workload (e.g., "John Doe (5/10)")
   - "(5/10)" means agent has 5 active orders out of max 10
4. Click **"Assign"** to confirm

### 4. **Agent Capacity Management**

**Understanding Capacity**:
- Each agent has a maximum of **10 active orders** (default)
- Active orders = orders in Pending, Validated, or Processing status
- Completed orders don't count toward capacity

**What happens when capacity is reached**:
- Assignment will fail with error message
- You'll see: "Agent workload limit exceeded. Active orders: 10/10"
- Must wait for agent to complete orders OR reassign some orders

**Viewing Agent Workload**:
- In assignment dialog: Shows as "(current/max)" next to agent name
- Example: "Jane Smith (8/10)" means Jane has 8 active orders

## Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Check agent workload before assigning
- Distribute orders evenly among agents
- Update status as orders progress
- Use the quick assign for faster workflows
- Unassign orders if agent is overloaded

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Assign to agents at full capacity
- Skip status transitions (e.g., Pending ‚Üí Completed)
- Leave orders unassigned for too long
- Reassign without checking current agent workload

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter` (in dropdowns) - Confirm selection

- **Solution**: 
  1. Choose a different agent
  2. Wait for agent to complete orders

### "Failed to assign order"
